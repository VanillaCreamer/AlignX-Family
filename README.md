## :sparkles: Introduction
<strong>AlignX-Family</strong> is a research initiative dedicated to advancing the personalization of large language models (LLMs). Launched in late 2024, the project is driven by a central conviction: <strong>personalization is a cornerstone for making the superintelligence exhibited by state-of-the-art LLMs broadly accessible and practically useful to diverse users.</strong> At the time of its inception, however, the community faced a critical gap—there were neither high-quality open-source datasets nor a systematic research framework to support rigorous and reproducible studies of LLM personalization.

AlignX-Family was established to address this gap. The initiative originated from an early research effort codenamed <strong><a href="./AlignX/README.md">AlignX</a></strong>, which focuses on constructing a large-scale dataset for personalized alignment. As the foundational work of the project, AlignX not only provides essential data infrastructure for subsequent explorations, but also lends its name to the broader research family. Building upon this foundation, we further investigated how user preferences can be dynamically reasoned as natural-language summaries from complex and often noisy behavioral signals. These efforts led to the development of <strong><a href="./AlignXplore/README.md">AlignXplore</a></strong> and its extension, <strong><a href="./AlignXplorePlus/README.md">AlignXplore+</a></strong>, which progressively elevate personalization from data construction, to preference reasoning, and ultimately to a universal interface for downstream applications. <strong><a href="./AlignXada/README.md">AlignXada</a></strong> extends this line of work with training-free adaptation, learning textual refinement policies that specialize universal user profiles for downstream personalization tasks while keeping model weights frozen.


In parallel, the broader landscape of LLM development has rapidly shifted toward personalization. Leading industry models are increasingly incorporating mechanisms such as long-term memory, interactive preference elicitation, and explicit style control. While these advances deliver impressive user experiences, the <strong>core technologies underpinning personalized intelligence largely remain closed and inaccessible to the research community</strong>, limiting transparency, reproducibility, and collective progress.


Through full open-sourcing, AlignX-Family aims to bring personalization to the forefront of LLM research. The project aspires to serve as a foundational resource and shared research platform for the community—enabling the development of superintelligent systems that are not only powerful, but also deeply aligned with individual users.


<!--
To date, AlignX-Family comprises four research works:
- <strong><a href="#package-alignx">AlignX</a></strong> contributes the largest open-source dataset for personalized alignment.
- <strong><a href="#robot-alignxplore">AlignXplore</a></strong> introduces a deep-reasoning approach to infer user preferences from complex behavioral signals, with its key technical innovation being the ability to dynamically update preferences from streaming user interactions.
- <strong><a href="#robot-zap-alignxplore">AlignXplore+</a></strong> further unlocks the potential of AlignXplore — learning preference inference models from heterogeneous signals and extending their impact far beyond response selection to power a broad range of personalized applications, from recommendation to response generation.
- <strong><a href="./AlignXada/README.md">AlignXada</a></strong> adapts universal user profiles to downstream personalization tasks through training-free verbal meta-learning.

## :link: Project Lineage
Our research follows a roadmap of <strong>Data → Methodology → Scaling → Adaptation</strong>, progressively advancing the study of personalization in large language models.

To date, the project comprises four tightly connected sub-projects:

### :package: <strong> <a href="./AlignX/README.md">AlignX</a> — Data </strong>

AlignX establishes the data foundation of the family by open-sourcing <strong> over 1.3 million examples </strong> to the research community for personalized alignment. It provides large-scale training resources and standardized evaluation testbeds, laying the groundwork for subsequent developments in AlignXplore and AlignXplore+.

### :robot: <strong> <a href="./AlignXplore/README.md">AlignXplore</a> — Methodology </strong>

AlignXplore introduces a deep-reasoning framework for inferring user preferences from complex behavioral signals. Its key technical innovation lies in enabling <strong> dynamic preference updates from streaming user interactions </strong>, paving the way toward representing user preferences as structured natural-language summaries.

### :zap: <strong> <a href="./AlignXplorePlus/README.md">AlignXplore+</a> — Scaling </strong>

Building upon AlignXplore, AlignXplore+ explores how preference reasoning can be scaled <strong> across heterogeneous data sources </strong> — including social media, e-commerce platforms, and news streams — and <strong> generalized across tasks and models </strong>, demonstrating the viability of natural language as a universal interface for transferable personalization.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: <strong> <a href="./AlignXada/README.md">AlignXada</a> — Adaptation </strong>

AlignXada adapts task-agnostic universal user profiles to specific downstream personalization tasks through <strong> training-free verbal meta-learning </strong>. It learns a reusable textual refinement policy from a small support set, applies that policy to unseen profiles, and keeps the meta, rewrite, and downstream model weights frozen throughout the process.

## Dataset Overview

# AlignXpert
We implement In-Context Alignment (ICA) and Preference-Bridged Alignment (PBA) based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. We train the model using the 7% subset (91,918 samples) and the full dataset (1,311,622 samples), respectively. The experimental results are shown in the table below, where our model significantly outperforms the baselines.

`./AlignXpert/eval/loss_ica.py` and `./AlignXpert/eval/loss_pba.py` are used to calculate the log probability of chosen and rejected responses with AlignXpert<sub>ICA</sub> and AlignXpert<sub>PBA</sub> as the policy models, respectively. `./AlignXpert/eval/loss_few_shot.py` calculates the log probability of chosen and rejected responses for the reference model. After obtaining the log probabilities for both the policy and reference models, `./AlignXpert/eval/acc.py` is used to compute the Alignment Accuracy.

<strong>AlignXplore</strong> is a deep user understanding framework designed to infer rich and human-readable preference summaries from complex—even noisy—behavioral signals.
- <strong>Streaming</strong>: Built for streaming scenarios. As new signals arrive, AlignXplore incrementally updates existing preference summaries through lightweight reasoning—eliminating the need to rerun costly end-to-end inference from scratch.
- <strong>Flexible</strong>: Supports heterogeneous input formats out of the box, including preference pairs (e.g., post–chosen–rejected comparisons) and free-form text signals such as user-generated content.
- <strong>Robust</strong>: Delivers stable and reliable performance under noisy inputs and remains resilient to abrupt or long-term shifts in user preferences.
